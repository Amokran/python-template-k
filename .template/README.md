# python-template-k

**A personal and basic template for most python projects.**

- Includes a basic structure, a README file, a LICENSE file, and a .gitignore file.
- It also includes VERSION, CHANGELOG, and CONTRIBUTING files.
- And a requirements.txt file for dependencies.

More than enough to start a basic python project.

**This one also includes custom made modules** such as [pypyrus](https://github.com/Amokran/pypyrus) for multi-language support or [pyzkolari](https://github.com/Amokran/pyzkolari) for logging. This modules, you can find also in my GitHub.

This modules are just imported, not included as git submodules. I advise you to clone them locally, create a virtual environment, and install them with pip. In case you don't know how to do that, you can check out the README file in the modules repositories.
